            <p>
                It all started with a healthy baking obsession and a desire to help people. Founders, Grace and Lily Kueber,have always been interested in owning a non-profit, it was just a question of what is the cause? They contemplated various ideas. No matter what, it always went back to wanting to help the homeless. <br><br>
                Grace was involved in many mission trips to the Dominican Republuc. Each time, she was required to get a sum of money to pay off the expenses, so Lily always tried to help raise the money. This caused them to realize their love for the background work. Lily was not the biggest traveler, but she still wanted to help. <br><br>
                The two sisters decided that they wanted to dedicate their lives into nonprofit work. They researched many different kinds until they found one they figured would fit well. Lily has always had a love for baking. She would bake dozens of cookies and treats for her school every other week as a way to relieve stress. She found her love for baking and wanted to combine that with her and her sister's desire for a nonprofit. <br><br>
                That is where this company started. A percent of the funds made through this bakery goes to helping the homeless. An amount goes to local houses and soup kitchens and then rest goes into buying various needs for people who have very little. Any and all donations will straight to the cause.
