IMPORTATNT: The code for the website is broken and no longer searchable. It is still readable, but images and certain functions are not functional 
            due to the deletion of the server, images, and various files. This project was for my freshman year of college and after transferring 
            sophomore year the account it was created under was removed. The files that I was able to recover are in the folder, but it is no
            longer complete and usable. The review page is no longer working and the reviews have been lost.

This code was written for a final project in a web design and implementation class in 2022. It uses html, scss, and css files.

The assignment was to make your own webpage using the techniques learned throughout the year. The focus of the project was on making a website
for a bakery and included personal baked creation images and reviews from friends that were submitted through a form that would then upload
to the website directly. The website was published in Spring of 2022 and taken down sometime after.
